    <h3>On Wasting Time</h3>
    <h5>Posted on 30.08.2021</h5>
    <p>Every one of us has, in due course of our lives, heard or said many phrases relating to the wastage of time.<br> 
    ‘Don’t be late, don’t waste time. etc. are some of the oft-repeated words.<br>
    These appear foolish to those who believe that all that is happening or will happen in the future is pre-ordained.<br> For the delay in projects or preponement of them is all for the best.<br> They hold the opinion that all that is happened is for the best. These people see the silver lining even in the darkest period of human life.</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Time is relative. For two sets of people living in the same time span, the pace of time may appear different. It may be slow for a person waiting for his beloved and fast for those on their way to an interview.<br> For a prisoner, the time will crawl, while for a businessman, the time flies.</li>
        <li>The great spiritual leaders like Nanak, Buddha, etc. have therefore broken through this time web before embarking on a path of Nirvana.<br> This means that they have attained a stage where regulations of time and space do not matter.</li>
        <li>On a plane of clear analysis, we will discover that it is not the humans that waste time. It is the time that wastes humans, who slowly grow old and finally die.<br> The continuous cycle of birth and death is a testimony to this fact.</li>
    </ul>
